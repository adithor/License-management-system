License Management and Validation System
Overview
This project implements a License Management and Validation System for Software as a Service (SaaS) products. It consists of a central server to validate and manage licenses, a client-side component to validate licenses in SaaS applications, and a secure database to store license information.

The system is designed with features like license activation, license revocation, offline mode support, and a web-based administrative interface for managing licenses.

Features
License Validation: Validates the license key of a SaaS product with a central server.
License Revocation: Supports revoking licenses in case of misuse or expiration.
Offline Mode Support: Limited functionality available when the client is temporarily offline.
Secure Communication: Uses HTTPS (recommended) and encryption for license management.
Administrator Dashboard: (To be developed) Allows management of licenses, view usage statistics, and revoke licenses.
Scalable and Modular: Easily expandable to handle more clients and features.
Requirements
Python 3.8+
Flask - Web framework for the server.
SQLAlchemy - ORM for database management.
SQLite (default) or another database system.
Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/license-management-system.git
cd license-management-system
2. Set Up the Server
2.1 Install Dependencies
Navigate to the server/ directory and install the required Python dependencies.

bash

cd server
pip install -r requirements.txt
2.2 Configure the Database
The system uses SQLite by default. If you want to use another database (e.g., PostgreSQL), update the database URI in app.py.


app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///licenses.db'
2.3 Initialize the Database
Run the following commands to initialize the database:

bash

flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
This will create the required tables for managing licenses.

3. Start the Server
To run the Flask server:

bash

python app.py
The server will be running locally at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

4. Client-Side License Validator
The client-side license validator is located in the client/ directory. To test the license validation process, edit the license key in license_validator.py and run:

bash

python license_validator.py
This will send a request to the server to validate the license.

5. License Validation API
The API endpoint for validating licenses is:

URL: /validate_license
Method: POST
Payload: { "license_key": "LICENSE-KEY-HERE" }
Example Request:

bash

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/validate_license -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"license_key":"SAMPLE-LICENSE-KEY"}'
Example Use Case
A SaaS product will include the client-side License Validator.
Each time the product is run, the validator checks the license key with the License Management Server.
If the license is valid, the product functions normally. If the license is invalid or expired, the product is restricted or blocked.
Future Work
Administrative Interface: Build a web-based dashboard for administrators to manage licenses, revoke them, and view usage statistics.
Offline Mode: Implement offline mode support in the client-side component.
Security Enhancements: Add HTTPS and additional encryption for communication.
